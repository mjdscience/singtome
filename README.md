# singtome
A short python program that uses three buttons to record and play songs invented by my daughter.

My daughter is at the age where she sings these long epic songs that are a mixup of every melody she can think of.  These songs are one of a kind, and they have no real structure.  If they are anything, they are 'all verse no chorus'.  I built a device that would record these.  I used a Raspberry Pi and three buttons, as well as a pair of speakers and a USB microphone.  The three buttons (1) start and (2) stop a recording and then (3) play it back.
There is a lot more that could be done with this, and this simple program is just a start.
